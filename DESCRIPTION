Description: Prediction markets allow self-interested traders to
    buy and sell futures contracts tied to binary outcomes. As the traders
    perceive these outcomes to become more or less likely, demand rises
    and falls. The equilibrium price of these contracts adjusts to
    reflects the crowd-sourced probability of the outcome. Can these
    markets produce useful and accurate election predictions? How do these
    predictions compared to those quantitative probabilities derived from
    polling? This package contains all the code and data needed to compare
    daily predictions for competitive races in the 2018 and 2020 U.S.
    elections.
